# Semicolon in a Haystack

This is a terminal game written in C. The game consists of looking for a missing semi colon in some code taken from FFMPEG. The point of the game is to find as many missing semi colons as possible before the end of some song.

To play, clone the directory, compile the game using `gcc main.c -o game` and play the game with `./game`. To play music, `vlc` must be installed. Tested on Ubuntu 20.04
